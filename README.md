# 🚀✨ Welcome to My Coding Journey! 🚀✨

👋 Hello there! 👋 I'm Nidhi Upman 😀, a dedicated competitive programmer 🌟 actively participating on Codeforces 🏆. Let me take you through my journey and the topics I've mastered along the way. 🚀

## My Codeforces Journey 🏆
In the beginning, 🥳 I could solve basic problems (like A) during contests 🏁, but struggled with tougher ones. 😅 However, I never gave up! 💪 After each contest, 🏁 I diligently upsolved problems 📈 that stumped me, gradually improving my skills. 🔧 Soon, I began tackling more challenging problems (like B), 🧠 gaining deeper insights into advanced concepts. 💡

Codeforces hosts contests 2-3 times every week, 🗓️ keeping me engaged and sharpening my skills. ✨ Outside of contests, 🏁 I tackle daily challenges 📅 that I couldn't crack during the competition. 🏋️

I'm currently a Codeforces newbie, 👶 but I'm determined to climb up the ranks through hard work and perseverance. 💪 My goal is to swiftly move up to Pupil and beyond! 🚀
